ROUGH draft, and I don't know if all the syntax is correct. I googled if 'String' is the right validator for email and it is. 

***App functionality revolves around the ***logged in user***

feature creep can doom a project! Focus on MVP for now.

I think we said that all the edit/create/delete stuff would be in the user portion, since that makes most sense.

GitHUB requirement notes:
    Because your app's functionality revolves around the logged in user, ***implement authentication and basic navigation first!***
    Prioritize and implement the user stories one at a time
